Based on the data model used in Enlight several algorithms 




Although the thesis and implemented prototypes will focus on extracting a surface mesh from Enlight's model, the presented algorithms are generic and also suitable for similar scenarios which depend on boolean operations like CSG (constructive solid geometry) trees.
