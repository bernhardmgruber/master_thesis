Due to the importance in CAE it is therefore highly desired to be able to retrieve an explicit surface mesh of the implicitly described model of Enlight.



Although the thesis and implemented prototypes will focus on extracting a surface mesh from Enlight's model, the presented algorithms are generic and also suitable for similar scenarios which depend on boolean operations like CSG (constructive solid geometry) trees.
