Simulation and visualization of material removal processes are vital for verifying the correctness of a machining process. However, there exist numerous scenarios where an explicit surface model of the final product is required. Many of these situations occur in CAE (computer-aided engineering) such as stress, thermal and safety analyses as well as structural optimizations using finite element methods.

Due to the importance in CAE it is therefore highly desired to be able to retrieve an explicit surface mesh of the implicitly described model of Enlight.



Although the thesis and implemented prototypes will focus on extracting a surface mesh from Enlight's model, the presented algorithms are generic and also suitable for similar scenarios which depend on boolean operations like CSG (constructive solid geometry) trees.
