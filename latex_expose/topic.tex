The following Expos\`e and proposed thesis discusses the reconstruction of an triangle based surface mesh from a given implicitly defined geometry model. The triangle mesh will also be referred to as explicit model in the meaning of it being directly usable for popular tasks like rendering for visualization or simulations using finite element methods. Contrary, the term implicit will be used to address models which do not satisfy the requirements for explicit models. Implicit models (cf. \cite{implicit_techniques}) may be composed of polygons, parametric surfaces and functional representations (iso surfaces). Furthermore, many and also different types of such surfaces may be aggregated, referred to as B-rep (boundary representation), or combined using set operations such as in CSG (constructive solid geometry).
