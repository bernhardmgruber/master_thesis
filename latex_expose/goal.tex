
\chapter{Goal}

At least three different surface extraction methods.

\section{Direct intersection}
Naive approach. Intersects each structure with each other structure. Bad asympthotic runtime complexity (squared). Probably numerical instability.



\section{Voxel based}

Use voxel grid to classify cells as inside, outside and surface regarding the triangles.

Marching cubes

Extended marching cubes

Feature extraction and conservation



\section{Dexel based}

Tri dexel



Pointclouds

Retriangulation using ball pivoting algorithm or GS2
