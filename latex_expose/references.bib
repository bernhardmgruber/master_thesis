	annotation={This paper proposes a method for enhancing the visual appeal of mesh intersections in video games and similar applications. To soften sharp intersection lines between two objects (e.g. rocks on a beach), geometry can be morphed around the intersection of both meshes and textured differently (using texture bands). The intersecting itself is computed using triangle-triangle intersection tests and constrained Delaunay triangulations of the cut triangles using the intersection segments on the triangle as constraints. }

@article{cutter_workpiece_engagement,
	title={Triangle-mesh based cutter-workpiece engagement extraction for general milling processes},
	author={Gong, Xun},
	year={2013},
	publisher={University of British Columbia},
	annotation={Master thesis describing how cutter-workpiece engagement can be extracted from a given cutter and workpiece geometry as well as a chain of cutter transformations over time. Cutter geometry and transformation paths are used to generate the volume swept by the cutter (swept volume) by reducing the cutter mesh to a point cloud which is than interpolated along the cutter's path using the cutter's chain of transformations. The resulting point cloud is re-triangulated using the ball pivoting algorithm and subtracted from the workpiece mesh. By increasing the cutter's size by a small amount, an intersection test can be performed against the cut workpiece to find the engagement area of the cutter. This area can than be used for calculating forces occuring during the simulated machining process. }

	annotation={Based on the marching cubes algorithm, this paper provides a strategy for improving features extracted from a given volumetric data set (a regular grid containing triangles, points, implicit surface functions or scalar distance fields). The proposed extended marching cubes algorithm employs a post-processing step which detects features inside a cell using e.g. normal vectors of the contained points. Additional vertices may then be generated to improve the reconstructed surface, especially concerning features like sharp edges. The discussed algorithm is implemented in OpenVDB.}

The presented implementation is directly based on the regular grid data structure which will be used as primary input for the surface reconstruction tackled by this thesis. Beside grid traversal, intersection counting and optimizations, acceleration by surface cell evaluation (SCE) and triangle elimination is presented. The latter two have direct implications for the reconstruction process. }

The algorithm does not need normal vectors for each point as it takes them from interpolated tangent planes. The surface is described as a signed distance function, estimating the distance of each sample point to the actual surface. This function is then sampled again by a marching cubes variant which emits the triangles of the surface. }
