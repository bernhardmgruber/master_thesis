\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to deeply thank my academical supervisor, FH-Prof. DI Dr. Werner Backfrieder, for the detailed reviews and feedback he gave me, which greatly helped to shape this thesis.

I also express my sincere gratitude to my company-side, technical mentor, DI (FH) Alexander Leutgeb, who gave me the initial idea for this thesis.
He advised me greatly in many algorithmic difficulties during the development of the implementations underlying this thesis.

I further thank my colleagues Michael Hava, MSc. and DI Thomas Ponweiser for sharing their in-depth knowledge about the C++ programming language and linear algebra, respectively, with me in dire situations.

My sincere appreciation also goes to the RISC Software GmbH itself, for providing me with an amazing work station and a comfortable atmosphere during my two years of employment which made working a pleasure.

In the end, I also want to thank my family for their personal support.
Without them, this thesis would not have been finished in time.

Lastly, the research projects Enlight and Engrave contributed as previous work to this thesis.
Both projects were co-funded by the European Union as well as the Federal Government of Upper Austria within the program Regio 13, which aims at the sustainable improvement of the contestability of regional companies, economic growth and employment of Upper Austria.
