\label{ch:direct_intersection}

The first presented method to extract a triangulated surface from the VML's data model is by directly processing the stored triangles inside the VML's regular grid.
This approach is the most naive, computationally intensive, but, in theory, most accurate.
It is conceptually equivalent to directly intersecting the mesh of the stock with each swept volume mesh.
Boolean operations on triangle meshes are already available in most CAD kernels.
However, these kernels usually require the meshes to be closed.
Due to the triangle elimination strategy using cell classification, \cf section \ref{sec:classification}, the meshes stored in the regular grid are no longer closed.
Thus, regular CAD kernels cannot be used to intersect the meshes maintained by the VML and a custom mesh intersection algorithm has been developed.


\section{Concept}
\label{sec:direct_intersection_concept}

Every time a swept volume is added to the VML, a unique id is generated and assigned to each of the swept volume's triangles before they are mapped to the cells of the regular grid.
As the stock is internally treated as a swept volume, by inverting the surface normals, all stock triangles are also assigned a unique id.
These ids allow to separate the triangles contained in the regular grid into the previous swept volumes, referred to as structures.
The separated structures are processed in pairs.
Each pair is united into a new structure.
The union of the two structure meshes is calculated by intersecting each triangle of one mesh with each triangle of the other mesh.
If two triangles intersect, the intersection line is recorded for both triangles.
After intersection, each triangle with intersection lines is split along these lines, retriangulated and replaced by the triangles resulting from the retriangulation.
All previous intersection lines are now edges of new triangles.
Each triangle of one structure is then tested against the other structure, whether the triangle is inside or outside the other structure, \eg by casting a ray from the triangle to the other structure.
As all triangles intersecting the opposite structure have been split, this property should be unambiguously determinable for each triangle.
By removing all triangles inside the opposite structure, the remaining triangles form a new surface which corresponds to the union of both structures.
This new structure is then again pairwise united with other structures until only one structure is left, \ie all structures are reduced to one.
This final structure is the reconstructed surface of the VML's data model.
Figure \ref{fig:cube2} demonstrates this workflow by the example of intersecting a cube with a cuboid.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:direct_intersection_implementation}

Due to the regular grid's classification, \cf section \ref{sec:classification}, triangles might have been removed and, consequently, the structures put together from the regular grid's cells may no longer be closed meshes.
As it turns out, the test whether a triangle is inside another structure may fail if the tested structure is not a closed mesh, a common case.
An example of such an issue is shown in figure \ref{fig:inside_test_error}.
%
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{inside_test_error}
	\caption{
		Testing if a triangle of one structure is inside another structure using a ray.
		Due to triangle elimination, the ray can miss removed structures, \eg when traversing outside cells, causing the inside test to fail, \cf left ray.
		As structures are guaranteed to be closed within a cell, this test is only valid within a cell, \cf right ray.
	}
	\label{fig:inside_test_error}
\end{figure}
%
A triangle is tested against a structure by using a ray.
This ray is shot from an arbitrary point on the triangle, which does not lie on an edge, \eg the triangle's centroid, to an arbitrary point on a triangle of the other structure.
If the ray does not intersect the other structure on its way, a comparison of the ray's direction with the normal of the targeted triangle determines whether the ray's origin, \ie the centroid of the tested triangle, is inside the other structure or not.
However, as classification might eliminate triangles, the ray could potentially intersect triangles of the structure which have been removed, \cf left ray in figure \ref{fig:inside_test_error}.
The regular grid only guarantees closed meshes within a cell.
To circumvent this issue, the inside test for a triangle must be conducted within a cell.

In general, intersecting each triangle of a structure against each other triangle of another structure is an expensive undertaking.
The cost of this operation is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, assuming both structures have $n$ triangles.
Intersecting the structures at the level of each cell greatly reduces the value of $n$.
Unfortunately, many triangles usually span the bounding box of a cell and are duplicated in each encompassed cell.
To avoid duplicates or overlapping triangles when combining results from neighboring cells, all triangles of a cell have to be clipped against the cell's bounding box.
This step can be done before or after intersecting the structures of a cell, but always before starting to eliminate triangles against the opposite structure.

An abstracted algorithm of this reconstruction approach is shown in algorithm \ref{alg:direct_intersection}.
The following sections discuss details of this algorithms and follow the order of subroutines/functions which are not yet defined.
The only exception is the \textproc{SeparateStructures} routine, which only groups the incoming triangles by their structure id.
It returns a list of structures, where each structure is a set of triangles.

\subsection{Clipping}
\label{sec:clipping}

Clipping triangles against the bounding box of a cell is necessary to avoid duplicated or invalid surfaces.
In cases where triangles span multiple cells, the VML duplicates each triangle into each cell it encompasses.
During intersection, only a triangle's intersections with structures of the current cell are recorded, although the triangle might be intersected by additional geometry in neighboring cells.
Therefore, after splitting, parts of the triangle which are outside the current cell are never split, might pass the inside test as a whole and remain as additional triangles outside the actual surface or remain colinear with surface triangles from neighboring cells.
To circumvent these issues, all triangles of a cell have to be clipped either before or after intersecting the two structures in \textproc{UnionStructure}.

Algorithms for clipping triangles against a bounding box are found in literature.
A well-known examples is the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm for polygon clipping \cite{polygon_clipping}.
Although further algorithms exist, \eg Weiler-Artherton, Vatti or Greiner-Hormann, which are either faster, more robust or have fewer restrictions on their input, the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm is characteristically simple.
In particular, it clips any polygon against any convex clip polygon by iteratively clipping it against infinitely extended lines along each edge of the clip polygon.
Despite being initially designed for 2 dimensions, the algorithm easily extends to higher dimensions.

For clipping triangles against the bounding box of a cell, a 3-dimensional version of the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm is needed.
Algorithm \ref{alg:clip} shows a pseudocode implementation of the \textproc{ClipStructure} routine which is based on the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm to clip all structure triangles against the bounding box of a cell.
%
When clipping a structure against a bounding box, each individual triangle of the structure is clipped separately.
The result of clipping a single triangle may be the same triangle, a set of new triangles or even no triangle at all.
The resulting triangles after clipping, if any, are collected to form the new, clipped structure.

The Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm clips against a convex polygon, or its equivalent in higher dimensions, \ie a polytope, by iteratively clipping against each side.
In case of a bounding box, the input polygon has to be clipped against each of the six sides of the cell.
These sides are extended and described as planes by specifying a normal vector and the plane's distance to the origin.
The six planes built from a cell's bounding box are given in the \textproc{ClipPolygonAABB} function of algorithm \ref{alg:clip}.
The input polygon itself is represented as an ordered list of vertices, where each pair of adjacent vertices form an edge of the polygon, including the last and the first vertex as a pair.
The order of the vertices remains the sames during the clipping process, but vertices may be removed or additional ones added.
The final vertex list, after clipping against all planes, needs to be triangulated again.
As the clipping volume, \ie the cell's bounding box, is convex, the resulting clipped polygon is also convex.
Therefore, the list of vertices can be simply triangulated into a fan by selecting one vertex and emitting a triangle for every adjacent pair of vertices excluding the selected vertex, where each triangle is built from the pair and the selected vertex.
Note that in some edge cases, duplicate vertices may be generated.
Thus, duplicates should be removed from the result vertex list before passing it to the triangulation subroutine.

The core routine of the clipping procedure is clipping the list of vertices against a single plane.
Initially, an empty list of result vertices is created.
For each of the polygon's vertices, the signed distance to the clipping plane is calculated.
The distance of each vertex is compared with the distance of its preceding vertex.
If the signs of the distances are different, the edge represented by the current vertex and its predecessor intersects the clipping plane.
In this case, the intersection point with the clipping plane is calculated, \cf algorithm \ref{alg:clip} for details, and the point is added to the result list.
If the distance of the current vertex is positive, the vertex itself is inside the clipping volume and is also added to the result list.
After all vertices have been processed, the result list is return, representing the clipped polygon again as an ordered list of its vertices.

\subsection{Triangle intersection}
\label{sec:triangle_intersection}

Every time the union surface of two structures is calculated, each triangle of one structure has to be intersected with each triangle of the other structure.
Triangle-triangle intersection is a common problem in collision detection and has been solved numerous times.
The intersection test of Möller \cite{tri_tri_intersection_moller}, despite being older and marginally slower than more recent developments \cite{tri_tri_intersection_2}, is also available as public domain C code on the authors website \cite{tri_tri_intersection_moller_code}.
As only a few adaptations were necessary, Möller's code was taken and thoroughly refactored to fit a modern C++ style without changing its behavior.
The \textproc{IntersectTriangle} routine referenced in algorithm \ref{alg:direct_intersection} is thus merely a small adapter calling into Möller's code and is given in algorithm \ref{alg:triangle_intersection}.
