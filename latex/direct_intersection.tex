\label{sec:direct_intersection}

The first presented method to extract a triangulated surface from the data model of the VML is by directly processing the stored triangles inside the regular grid of the VML.
This approach is the most straightforward, computationally intensive, but, in theory, most accurate one.
It is conceptually equivalent to directly intersecting the mesh of the stock with each swept volume mesh.
Boolean operations on triangle meshes are already available in most CAD kernels.
However, these kernels usually require the meshes to be closed.
Due to the triangle elimination strategy using cell classification, \cf \cref{sec:classification}, the meshes stored in the regular grid are no longer closed.
Thus, regular CAD kernels cannot be used to intersect the meshes maintained by the VML and a custom mesh intersection algorithm has been developed.
The idea of this approach is based on a work about finding and deforming the intersection between two meshes as well as applying textures to those regions to increase the realism in computer graphics, \ie computer games \cite{mesh_intersection}.

\subsection{Concept}
\label{sec:direct_intersection_concept}

Every time a swept volume is added to the VML, a unique identifier, \ie a number, is generated and assigned to each of the swept volume triangles before they are mapped to the cells of the regular grid.
As the stock is internally treated as a swept volume, by inverting the surface normals, all stock triangles are also assigned a unique identifier.
These identifiers allow to separate the triangles contained in the regular grid into the previous swept volumes, referred to as structures.
The identifiers of these structures are called structure ids.

The separated structures are processed in pairs.
Each pair is merged into a new structure.
The union of the two structure meshes is calculated by intersecting each triangle of one mesh with each triangle of the other mesh.
If two triangles intersect, the intersection line is recorded for both triangles.
After intersection, each triangle with intersection lines is split along these lines and retriangulated.
All previous intersection lines are now edges of new triangles.
Each triangle of one structure is then tested against the other structure, whether the triangle is inside or outside the other structure, \eg by casting a ray from the triangle to the other structure.
As all triangles, which initially intersected the opposite structure, have been split, this inside-or-outside property should be unambiguously determinable for each triangle.
By removing all triangles of a structure which are inside the opposite structure, the remaining triangles of both structures form a new surface which corresponds to the union of both structures.
This new structure is then again pairwise united with other structures until only one structure is left, \ie all structures are reduced to one.
This final structure is the reconstructed surface of the data model of the VML.
\Cref{fig:cube2} demonstrates this workflow by the example of intersecting a cube with a cuboid.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:direct_intersection_implementation}

In general, intersecting each triangle of a structure against each other triangle of another structure is an expensive procedure.
The cost of this operation is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, assuming both structures have $n$ triangles.
Intersecting the structures at the level of each cell greatly reduces the value of $n$.
Unfortunately, many triangles usually span the bounding boxes of several cells and are duplicated in each encompassed one.
To avoid duplicates or overlapping triangles when combining results from neighboring cells, all triangles of a cell have to be clipped against the bounding box of the cell.
This step can be done before or after intersecting the structures of a cell, but always before starting to eliminate triangles against the opposite structure.
There is also a second reason why this direct intersection approach must be run on a cell level which is discussed in \cref{sec:triangle_inside_test}.

An abstracted algorithm of this reconstruction approach is shown in \cref{alg:direct_intersection}.
The following sections discuss details of this algorithms and follow the order of subroutines/functions used within.
The only exception is the \textproc{SeparateStructures} routine, which only groups the incoming triangles by their structure id.
It returns a list of structures, where each structure is a set of triangles.

\subsection{Clipping}
\label{sec:clipping}

Clipping triangles against the bounding box of a cell is necessary to avoid duplicated or invalid surfaces.
In cases where triangles span multiple cells, the VML duplicates each triangle into each cell it encompasses.
During intersection, only the intersections of a triangle with structures of the current cell are recorded, although the triangle might be intersected by additional geometry in neighboring cells.
Therefore, after splitting, parts of the triangle which are outside the current cell are never split, might pass the inside test as a whole and remain as additional triangles outside the actual surface or remain collinear with surface triangles from neighboring cells.
To circumvent these issues, all triangles of a cell have to be clipped either before or after intersecting the two structures in \textproc{UnionStructure}.

Algorithms for clipping triangles against a bounding box are described in literature.
A well-known examples is the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm for polygon clipping \cite{polygon_clipping}.
Although further algorithms exist, \eg Weiler-Artherton, Vatti or Greiner-Hormann, which are either faster, more robust or have fewer restrictions on their input, the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm is characteristically simple.
In particular, it clips any polygon against any convex clip polygon by iteratively clipping it against infinitely extended lines along each edge of the clip polygon.
Despite being initially designed for two dimensions, the algorithm easily extends to higher dimensions.

For clipping triangles against the bounding box of a cell, a 3-dimensional version of the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm is needed.
\Cref{alg:clip} shows a pseudocode implementation of the \textproc{ClipStructure} routine which is based on the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm to clip all structure triangles against the bounding box of a cell.
%
When clipping a structure against a bounding box, each individual triangle of the structure is clipped separately.
The result of clipping a single triangle may be the same triangle, a set of new triangles or even no triangle at all.
The resulting triangles after clipping, if any, are collected to form the new, clipped structure.

The Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm clips against a convex polygon, or its equivalent in higher dimensions, \ie a polytope, by iteratively clipping against each side.
In case of a bounding box, the input polygon has to be clipped against each of the six sides of the cell.
These sides are extended and described as planes by specifying a normal vector and the plane distance to the origin.
The six planes built from the bounding box of a cell are given in the \textproc{ClipPolygonAABB} function of \cref{alg:clip}.
The input polygon itself is represented as an ordered list of vertices, where each pair of adjacent vertices form an edge of the polygon, including the last and the first vertex as a pair.
The order of the vertices remains the same during the clipping process, but vertices may be removed or additional ones added.
The final vertex list, after clipping against all planes, needs to be triangulated again.
As the clipping volume, \ie the bounding box of a cell, is convex, the resulting clipped polygon is also convex.
Therefore, the list of vertices can be simply triangulated into a fan by selecting one vertex and emitting a triangle for every adjacent pair of vertices excluding the selected vertex, where each triangle is built from the pair and the selected vertex.
Note that in some edge cases, duplicate vertices may be generated.
Thus, duplicates should be removed from the result vertex list before passing it to the triangulation subroutine.

The core routine of the clipping procedure is clipping the list of vertices against a single plane.
Initially, an empty list of result vertices is created.
For each of the vertices of the polygon, the signed distance to the clipping plane is calculated.
The distance of each vertex is compared with the distance of its preceding vertex.
If the signs of the distances are different, the edge represented by the current vertex and its predecessor intersects the clipping plane.
In this case, the intersection point with the clipping plane is calculated, \cf \cref{alg:clip} for details, and the point is added to the result list.
If the distance of the current vertex is positive, the vertex itself is inside the clipping volume and is also added to the result list.
After all vertices have been processed, the result list is return, representing the clipped polygon again as an ordered list of its vertices.

\subsection{Triangle intersection}
\label{sec:triangle_intersection}

Every time the union surface of two structures is calculated, each triangle of one structure has to be intersected with each triangle of the other structure.
Triangle-triangle intersection is a common problem in collision detection and has been solved numerous times.
The intersection test of Möller \cite{tri_tri_intersection_moller}, despite being older and marginally slower than more recent developments \cite{tri_tri_intersection_2}, is also available as public domain C code on the authors website \cite{tri_tri_intersection_moller_code}.
As only a few adaptations were necessary, the code of Möller was taken and thoroughly refactored to fit a modern C++ style without changing its behavior.
Since the code is quite long and freely available on the website of Möller, an implementation/algorithm is not included here.
The \textproc{IntersectTriangle} routine referenced in \cref{alg:direct_intersection} is thus merely a small adapter calling into the code of Möller and is given in \cref{alg:triangle_intersection}.

\begin{algorithm}

			\If{$\var{hasIntersected} \wedge \neg \var{isCoplanar}$}
				\State \Return $(\var{p}_1, \var{p}_2)$ \Comment{Otherwise return nothing}
			\EndIf
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption[Möller triangle-triangle intersection adapter]{

		This algorithm calls the C function \textproc{tri\_tri\_intersect\_with\_isectline} with all triangle vertices as inputs and $\var{coplanar}$, $\var{p}_1$ and $\var{p}_2$ as output parameters.
	}
	\label{alg:triangle_intersection}
\end{algorithm}

The triangle intersection test itself starts with an early exit test by computing the plane equation parameters, \ie normal and distance, for both triangles.
Then, the signed plane distance of each vertex of one triangle to the plane of the other triangle is calculated.
If the signs of these three values is the same for one triangle, it completely lies on one side of the plane and therefore does not intersect the other triangle.
This test is run for both triangles.
The intersection line between the two planes is calculated by crossing the normal vectors of the planes.
\Cref{fig:tri_intersect} shows the intersection line of the two triangle planes in green and is used to discuss the remaining part of the algorithm.
Now, the intervals of the line which lie inside the triangle have to be calculated.
For each pair of vertices of a triangle, \ie each edge, the two signed distances of the vertices to the plane of the other triangle are compared.
If they have a different sign, this edge intersects the plane of the other triangle and therefore crosses the intersection line of both planes.
The intersection point splits the edge with the same ratio as the signed distances of both vertices.
For each triangle, two intersecting edges are found, thus yielding an interval for each triangle, \cf blue segments of the line in \cref{fig:tri_intersect}.
If these two intervals overlap, the triangles intersect and their intersection line is the overlapping segment of the intersection line of the planes, \cf red segment in \cref{fig:tri_intersect}.
Otherwise, there is no intersection.

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{tri_intersect}

		Blue parts of the intersection line are intervals of one triangle.
		The red part is the overlap of the the line intervals of both triangles, \ie the intersection of both triangles.
		Image modeled after \cite[p757]{tri_tri_intersection_moller_image}.
	}
	\label{fig:tri_intersect}
\end{figure}

Extending beyond this concept, a further optimization is to not use the intersection line of the planes to project the intervals of the triangles onto, but to use the axis of the coordinate system where the direction of the intersection line has the largest magnitude.
This greatly simplifies several calculations except the actual points of the intersection segment.
Furthermore, the code of Möller additionally handles the case when both triangles are coplanar, \ie the signed distances of the vertices of one triangle to the plane of the other triangle are almost zero.



\subsection{Triangle splitting}
\label{sec:triangle_splitting}

After two structures have been intersected and all intersection lines per triangle have been recorded, the triangles can be split.
The result of splitting a triangle must be a new set of triangles in order to create a new structure from these which can be put into the \textproc{UnionStructure} routine again.
Hence, an algorithm for triangulating a triangle with respect to a set of lines is needed.
In the context of triangulations, this set of lines is usually called constraints or constrained edges and the according algorithm a constrained triangulation (CT).
Initially, a manually written CT was used.
Even though it was capable of triangulating simple cases, it suffered severely from numerical instability and poor output quality.
A stricter triangulation of higher quality is the constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT), which is also suggested by the work giving the initial idea to the direct intersection reconstruction approach \cite{mesh_intersection}.
However, as CDT algorithms are quite hard to implement regarding speed and robustness, using an established and tested library is highly recommended.
A list of C/C++ libraries offering constrained Delaunay triangulations is given in \cref{tbl:delaunay_libs}.
Several of these libraries have been tested for their suitability to retriangulate a triangle with a set of constraints.
Usually, these triangulation algorithms operate on 2-dimensional point clouds with optional constrained edges between points of this cloud.
As output they generate a Delaunay triangulation, with the convex hull of the point cloud as boundary.

The poly2tri library requires constraints to be specified as polylines which may not touch each other.
This is a problem as constraints may touch the boundary of the original triangle.

The Triangle library is used for splitting triangles at various constrained edges in another work \cite{mesh_intersection}.
Nevertheless, it has a very difficult C interface which tries to mimic a command line with text arguments even on its API level.
Furthermore, passing in and returning geometric data structures requires extensive care regarding memory management.
The library does not reliably work for all triangulation cases and sometimes crashes.

The Geometric Tools Engine (GTE) is a rather modern library with an excellent C++ interface.
The precision of the algorithms may be configured via templates.
The library runs outstandingly stable with only a few troubles in cases where the input was numerically problematic, \eg contained points with differences only at the last few digits representable with double precision.
However, these issues can be fixed with appropriate preprocessing of the input, \cf \cref{sec:numeric_improvements}.
Furthermore, the GTE library is licensed under the Boost License and therefore perfectly usable in commercial products like the VML.

The remaining libraries have not been further tested, mainly for the reason that the VML is a commercial product and the use of these libraries would require to drop the code again later.

The integration of the CDT of the GTE is done inside \textproc{SplitTriangle} which is given in \cref{alg:triangle_splitting}.

\end{algorithm}
%
A few preparations are necessary before the CDT subroutine can be called.
All points used by constrained edges must be part of the input point cloud and are therefore added to the point cloud formed by the input vertices of the triangle.

Furthermore, as the CDT only runs in two dimensions, all vertices are projected onto the plane spanned by the two coordinate system axes with the smaller magnitude in the normal vector of the triangle.
This operation is simple as it only requires the selection of two components of each point and no calculation.
As all constraints as well as the resulting triangulation are specified using indexes into the point cloud, the list containing the 2-dimensional, projected vertices must have the same order as the original point list.
Before starting the triangulation, the constrained edges have to be specified.
Each constraint is inserted by supplying a pair of indexes into the point cloud.
Afterwards, the CDT can be calculated.
The resulting triangulation is specified using a list of indexes.
The length of this list is a multiple of three and each consecutive three indexes form a triangle of the result.
When these indexes are resolved by indexing into the original point cloud, the vertices for the final triangles are obtained.
These triangles are finally returned.


\subsection{Triangle inside structure test}
\label{sec:triangle_inside_test}

After all triangles of two intersecting structures have been split on their intersection lines, all triangles which do not contribute to the union surface, \ie are inside the other structure, have to be removed.
Due to the classification of the regular grid, \cf \cref{sec:classification}, triangles might have been removed and, consequently, structures put together from multiple cells of the regular grid may no longer be closed meshes.
As it turns out, the test whether a triangle is inside another structure may fail if the tested structure is not a closed mesh, a common case.
An example of such an issue is shown in \cref{fig:inside_test_error}.

	}
	\label{fig:inside_test_error}
\end{figure}
%
A triangle is tested against a structure by using a ray.
This ray is shot from an arbitrary point on the triangle, which does not lie on an edge, \eg the centroid of the triangle, to an arbitrary point on a triangle of the other structure.
If the ray does not intersect the other structure on its way, a comparison of the direction of the ray with the normal of the targeted triangle determines whether the origin of the ray, \ie the centroid of the tested triangle, is inside the other structure or not.
However, as classification might eliminate triangles, the ray could potentially intersect triangles of the structure which have been removed, \cf left ray in \cref{fig:inside_test_error}.
The regular grid only guarantees closed meshes within a cell.
To circumvent this issue, the inside test for a triangle must be conducted within a cell.

An algorithm for this \textproc{IsTriangleInsideStructure} test is given in \cref{alg:triangle_inside_test}.

	\label{alg:triangle_inside_test}
\end{algorithm}
%
The function starts by calculating the origin and target point for the test ray.
The ray originates at the center of the tested triangle and initially targets the center of the first triangle of the other structure.
Distance and normal of the targeted triangle are stored.
Then, all other triangles of the structure are tested for intersection with the created ray.
If an intersection happens and the distance to the newly intersected triangle is shorter than the distance to the currently targeted triangle, the distance and normal are updated to the new triangle, \ie the ray now targets the new triangle.
This procedure ensures that after all triangles have been tested for intersection, the maintained distance and normal store the values of the closest intersection of the ray.
The normal of the closest intersected triangle of the other structure is then finally compared to the direction of the ray.
If they point into the same half space, the origin of the ray and therefore the tested triangle is inside the tested structure.

For ray-triangle intersection the famous Möller-Trumbore intersection test is used \cite{ray_triangle_intersection_moller}.
An implementation of their algorithm in C is already given in the corresponding work.
The original version has a few early exit tests on \var{u} and \var{v}, which might save some work in case the ray misses the triangle.
However, branching is becoming increasingly expensive on modern hardware architectures, especially in vectorized code paths or GPU code.
A branch-free version of Möller-Trumbore's intersection test, which is currently used and performs slightly better, is shown in \cref{alg:triangle_inside_test}.

The idea of the algorithm is shown in \cref{fig:ray_triangle_intersect}.

%
The intersection test relies on the idea that, with a simple transformation, the problem can be represented in a coordinate system where the solution is almost given.
This transformation should put the origin of the coordinate system at one vertex of the triangle.
The axes of the new system are the two triangle edges as well as the inverted ray direction.
If the problem is represented in this space, the origin of the ray holds the values of the $u$ and $v$ barycentric coordinate of the intersection point on the triangle as well as the distance $t$ of the triangle to the origin in multiples of the length of the ray direction vector.
$u$ and $v$ are used to test whether the intersection point lies within the triangle and $t$ can be used as parameter in the line equation of the ray, $X = O + D \cdot t$, to retrieve the point of intersection.
The transformation necessary consists of two steps.
The first is a translation of $O$ by $-V_0$ to move the origin of the coordinate system to a triangle vertex.
The second step is a change of basis with $\left[-D, V_1 - V_0, V_2 - V_0 \right]$ as base matrix.
This is done by multiplying with the inverse base matrix.
The result vector $\left[ t,  u,  v \right]$ then contains the desired values.
By moving the multiplication with the inversed base matrix to the other side, the equation in \cref{fig:ray_triangle_intersect} is obtained.
Möller and Trumbore solve this system of equations in matrix form using Cramer's rule.
The determinant of a matrix is calculated using a combination of a cross and a dot product, called the scalar triple product.
This allows to calculate the values of the solution vector incrementally to allow early exits.


\subsection{Numeric improvements}
\label{sec:numeric_improvements}

If the method described in this chapter would be tested on various scenes now, it would barely work for not even modest scenarios.
The problem is mainly numeric instability and the iterative nature of the approach.
Each calculation with a fixed precision is effected by small rounding errors when the result is stored back into a register or to memory.
This especially becomes a problem when theoretically equal calculations should practically yield equal results.
When two incident triangles for example intersect with a third triangle, the shared edge of the first two triangles should intersect at the same point on triangle three.
Depending on the order of operations this is not guaranteed.
The result may be different if, \eg, the two points representing the edge are swapped.
%
The triangle splitting algorithm for example can only hold its guarantees if the intersecting edges are true polylines with no gaps between the segments and their ends are exactly at the triangle edges.
Otherwise, degenerated triangles may be created between intersecting edges or at the triangle edges.
%
Another problem are algorithms which create very small numbers in intermediary calculations.
If a triangle is really thin, the dot product between the edges at the smallest corner is almost zero and suffers from numeric instability.
The cross product and therefore the normal vector also becomes unstable.
Calculations depending on these values might then critically misjudge a situation and \eg create intersection lines outside a triangle or falsely report a triangle as inside-a-structure based on a degenerated normal.
The problem with errors on such hard decisions is that they escalate with the number of iterations, which might be several hundreds or thousands.
If two structures are united but a wrongly discarded triangle left a hole, all following inside tests are affected and may fail.
Several improvements to mitigate degeneration and numeric errors are discussed in this section.

\begin{description}
	% drawings could be added here, but wbackfrieder is OK without

	\item[Collapse near points in structures] \hfill \\
	At the beginning of the \textproc{UnionStructure} algorithm almost no guarantees are given on the two input structures.
	As very thin or degenerated triangles are numerically problematic during the following algorithmic steps, \eg intersection or inside test, filtering them may avoid some of those problems.
	Therefore, all vertices which are closer than a defined small epsilon distance are collapsed to their mean values.
	Thus, no holes are created in the structure, only degenerated triangles.
	These are easy to filter in a post-processing step by removing all triangles where two or more vertices are equal.


	\item[Flush tiny values to zero] \hfill \\
	Floating point values with tiny exponents, \eg $10^{-15}$ and below, tend to make some calculations unstable, especially when collapsing vertices with such coordinates.
	Collapsed vertices with such values might still not compare equal afterwards which breaks subsequent calls to the CDT algorithm.
	The reason therefore is unfortunately not clear.
	However, flushing such small values to zero eliminates the problem.


	\item[Verify intersection line] \hfill \\
	In situations where two triangles are quite thin, the Möller-Trumbore intersection test may report an intersection and calculate an intersection line which lies outside one or both of the triangles.
	Subsequent CDTs will then generate additional triangles outside the split triangle, as CDT routines usually triangulate the convex hull of the input point set.
	This issue is avoided by an additional test run after the call to \textproc{IntersectTriangles}.
	If a triangle intersection is recorded, the points of the intersection line are tested if they lie on each of the triangles.
	The test is performed using a raycast with each point as origin and each triangle normal as ray direction.
	Only if the resulting $u$ and $v$ coordinates for both points are within their bounds including a small epsilon, \ie $-\epsilon \leq u \leq 1+\epsilon \wedge -\epsilon \leq v \leq 1+\epsilon \wedge u + v \leq 1 + \epsilon$, the intersection is accepted.


	\item[Collapse constraint vertices with structure vertices] \hfill \\
	Some of the intersection lines on a triangle might be very close to its vertices.
	To avoid creating degenerated triangles during CDT, all vertices of constraints are checked against the vertices of the triangle to ensure a minimum distance.
	If a distance is less than a specified minimum, the affected vertex is set to the corresponding vertex of the triangle.


	\item[Collapse near points in constraints per triangle] \hfill \\
	This correction is the most important one.
	After all intersection lines have been recorded, collapse all constraint vertices which are closer than a defined epsilon distance.
	This routine ensures that each pair of incident triangles intersecting another triangle produce an incident pair of constraints.
	In other words, constrained edges which are not connected to each other because of numerical issues in the intersection routine are rejoined again to form closed polylines.
	Furthermore, tiny constraints collapse to points and are removed.
	This matter is important for correct splits after running the CDT.


	\item[Ensure unique constraints] \hfill \\
	Constraint uniqueness is a small and simple check.
	The test is required as duplicated constraints impose a problem for some CDT libraries.


	\item[Specify hull constraints] \hfill \\
	Most CDT libraries triangulate a given point cloud within the convex hull of the cloud.
	Identifying the edges belonging to the convex hull is usually deterministic if the points are in what is called general position, \ie no coincident or collinear points.
	However, the vertices of a triangle and a set of constraints where many constraints end at the edges of the triangle contain a lot of collinear points.
	In order to help the CDT in finding the right hull, it is recommended to specify the hull manually via additional constraints.
	These hull constraints are constructed from the triangle vertices and the constraint vertices touching an edge of the triangle.
	The latter are identified by counting the number of constraints incident to each vertex of a point set formed by all vertices of constraints.
	Vertices with only one incident constraint must lie at the border of the triangle and are therefore hull vertices.
	Together with the vertices of the triangle, the hull vertices are ordered cyclical around their center of mass.
	The hull constraints are then formed from each adjacent pair of the ordered hull vertices including the constraint from the last to the first hull vertex.
	These hull constraints are appended to the constraints created by the intersection lines as input to the CDT.


	\item[Remove degenerate triangles after CDT] \hfill \\
	Despite good preparation of the input, it might still be the case that tiny or degenerated triangles are generated by the CDT routine, especially along the hull.
	The vertices of such triangles are apart far enough to pass vertex collapse in a following iteration.
	Therefore, a check on the angles of the triangle is preferred.
	If the dot product of any pair of incident, normalized edges of the triangle is approaching zero, \ie is below a defined epsilon, the triangle is removed from the triangulation result.
\end{description}


\subsection{Parallelization}
\label{sec:parallelization}

By choosing to solve the intersections of all structures per cell, the main routine in \cref{alg:direct_intersection} became embarrassingly parallel.
As the regular grid usually consists of a larger number of cells, \eg $100 \times 100 \times 100$ is quite common, scheduling each cell in parallel is probably the best option for parallelization.
However, a good scheduling strategy is needed, as the workload per cell is highly diverse.
Most of the cells are empty because they are either inside or outside cells and require no processing.
But also the amount of triangles and structures in each surface cell varies drastically between a few triangles and several thousands.

If all structures would be closed, \ie triangle elimination by classification would be disabled, and there would be no subdivision into cells, the iterative creation of the union structure could be parallelized instead.
Always combining two elements of a set of elements until only one is left is an algorithm known as reduction, fold or accumulation.
Reductions are usually parallelized as a tree.
Each independent pair of elements can be reduced into one in parallel.
However, tree-shaped parallel reduction offers suboptimal parallelism, especially against the end where only a few parallel pairs remain.
Parallelizing the reduction of all surfaces into one, in addition to a cell-based parallelization, is probably superfluous.
The still high number of surface cells provide enough parallel work to saturate most workstations or even server CPUs.

Most routines inside the \textproc{UnionStructure} algorithm are also viable candidates for parallelization, although the workload is significantly smaller.
A structure inside a cell usually does not consist of more than 50 - 100 triangles.
These routines would probably benefit from data parallelism and SIMD constructs, \ie vectorization.
Especially the \textproc{ClipPolygonAABB}, \textproc{IntersectTriangles} and \textproc{IsTriangleInsideStructure} algorithms contain only a few branches and operate on simple data structures, \ie arrays.

Considering alternative hardware architectures like GPUs or similar accelerators, \eg the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, a parallelization based on the cells of the regular grid is recommended.
The reason is that the number of cells is known at the beginning of the whole calculation which allows static scheduling of the entire work size.
This property is mandatory when programming for GPUs, but has been softened in recent years by the introduction of dynamic parallelism in CUDA 5.0 and OpenCL 2.0.
Furthermore, most GPU architectures rely on either vectorization or execution of thread groups in lockstep\footnote{
	Most GPUs usually schedule groups of threads, called warps with 32 threads by NVIDA and wavefronts with 64 threads by AMD.
	These threads are tied together and executed instruction-wise, meaning all threads execute the same instruction on their individual data in parallel.
	This behavior is also called lockstep execution and the paradigm single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT).
	If some threads branch differently than others, \eg if, while or for statements, all threads execute both branches, but some of them are masked out to avoid changes by the executed instructions.
	The on-chip GPUs of Intel rely on vectorization which has to be done manually by the programmer for medium and advanced algorithms.} to achieve a high throughput.
Thus, the uneven workloads in all loops, \eg number of structures per cell, number of triangles per structure or number of intersections, hardly saturate these architectures, probably causing many threads to run empty loops because of a few larger cells or structures.

In the underlying implementation, only the topmost loop of the \textproc{DirectIntersection} function has been parallelized using the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) of Microsoft and the parallel\_for function which uses a scheduler implementing work stealing to balance the workload \cite{ppl_parallel_for}.
