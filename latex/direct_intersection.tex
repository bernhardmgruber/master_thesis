\label{ch:direct_intersection}

The first presented method to extract a triangulated surface from the VML's data model is by directly processing the stored triangles inside the VML's regular grid.
This approach is the most naive, computationally intensive, but, in theory, most accurate.
It is conceptually equivalent to directly intersecting the mesh of the stock with each swept volume mesh.
Boolean operations on triangle meshes are already available in most CAD kernels.
However, these kernels usually require the meshes to be closed.
Due to the triangle elimination strategy using cell classification, \cf section \ref{sec:classification}, the meshes stored in the regular grid are no longer closed.
Thus, regular CAD kernels cannot be used to intersect the meshes maintained by the VML and a custom mesh intersection algorithm has been developed.
