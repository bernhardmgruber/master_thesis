\section{Motivation and background}
Explicit vs implicit surface models
Transformation (do not use conversion) from implicit to explicit


\section{Problem statement}
Transform implicit models (similar to Enlight) into triangle mesh

\section{Goal}
Research, prototype and compare different approaches on various test scenes
