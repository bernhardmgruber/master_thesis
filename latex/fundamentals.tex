\subsection{Terms and definitions}


Implicit models may be composed of polygons, parametric surfaces and functional representations (iso surfaces).
Furthermore, many and also different types of such surfaces may be aggregated, referred to as B-rep (boundary representation), or combined using set operations such as in CSG.

Delaunay

A triangulation is called Delaunay when the circumcircle of each triangle does not contain a vertex of another triangle. Delaunay triangulations produce very regular and visually appealing triangle meshes.
