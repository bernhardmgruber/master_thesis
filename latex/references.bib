To soften sharp intersection lines between two objects (e.g. rocks on a beach), geometry can be morphed around the intersection of both meshes and textured differently (using texture bands). The intersecting itself is computed using triangle-triangle intersection tests and constrained Delaunay triangulations of the cut triangles using the intersection segments on the triangle as constraints. }

	year={2013},
	publisher={University of British Columbia},
	annotation={Master thesis describing how cutter-workpiece engagement can be extracted from a given cutter and workpiece geometry as well as a chain of cutter transformations over time. Cutter geometry and transformation paths are used to generate the volume swept by the cutter (swept volume) by reducing the cutter mesh to a point cloud which is than interpolated along the cutter's path using the cutter's chain of transformations. The resulting point cloud is re-triangulated using the ball pivoting algorithm and subtracted from the workpiece mesh. By increasing the cutter's size by a small amount, an intersection test can be performed against the cut workpiece to find the engagement area of the cutter. This area can than be used for calculating forces occuring during the simulated machining process. }

The proposed extended marching cubes algorithm employs a post-processing step which detects features inside a cell using e.g. normal vectors of the contained points. Additional vertices may then be generated to improve the reconstructed surface, especially concerning features like sharp edges. The discussed algorithm is implemented in OpenVDB.}
