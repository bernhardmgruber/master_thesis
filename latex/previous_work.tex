As stated in the problem statement in section \ref{sec:problem} the focus of the implementations underlying this thesis is to implement multiple strategies to extract a triangulated surface mesh from the data model used inside the VML.
To aid the reader in understanding the implementations present in this thesis, a short introduction to the VML and its data model is given.
Parts of this description have been taken from the authors bachelor thesis where the data model has been previously described with the focus on visualization \cite{bachelor}.

\section{Project history}
\label{sec:project_history}

From mid 2011 until the end of 2013 project Enlight was conducted for research by the RISC Software GmbH in Hagenberg im M\"uhlkreis, Austria.
Enlight's goals were to develop a faster, scalable and numerically stable method for modeling and visualizing subtractive manufacturing.
Enlight used a regular grid data structure to store a stock solid and add precomputed swept volumes.
A triangle elimination strategy was employed to keep the total number of triangles held by the grid within manageable bounds.
For visualization a customized ray casting approach was developed \cite{enlight} and accelerated using GPUs and many-core architectures.

From the beginning to the end of 2014, the follow-up research project Engrave focused on solving swept volume computation for arbitrary cutter geometries and tool paths.
Engrave basically allowed dynamic swept volume computation from a set of cutter solids and transformation lists.
Swept volume computation was done by extruding a point cloud along the tool path and then reconstruction a closed triangle mesh from it using a parallel and highly optimized variant of the ball pivoting algorithm 
\cite{engrave}.
The computed swept volumes where directly imported into Enlight's data model.

Both projects, Enlight and Engrave, were co-funded by the European Union as well as Land Ober\"osterreich within the political program Regio 13, which aimed to sustainably improve the contestability of regional companies, economic growth and employment inside of Upper Austria.

With the beginning of 2015 the prototype developed during Enlight and Engrave was rebranded to Virtual Machining Library (VML) and is currently further developed as a commercial product.

\section{VML data model}
\label{sec:vml_data_model}

The primary purpose of the VML is to model, simulate and visualize subtractive manufacturing.
A typical workflow consists of loading a stock solid and then repeatedly sweeping various cutting tools over the stock.
These cutting tools are solid triangle meshes loaded from disk which are moved along paths (list of transformation matrices) to create swept volumes (generated triangle meshes).
These swept volumes are then conceptually subtracted from the stock.
In fact, swept volumes are stored side by side together with the stock and theoretically build up a specialized CSG tree as shown in figure \ref{fig:vml_csg}.
A separate processing step is required to calculate the exact surface.
For visualization, the data model is sampled using a raycast which calculates a point on the surface for each ray.

	}
	\label{fig:vml_csg}
\end{figure}


The central data structure inside the VML which holds the current state of the simulation (\ie the workpiece) is a regular 3-dimensional grid.
This data structure was chosen because, historically, it was directly used as acceleration structure for the raycasting subsystem.
Although there is a wide variety of acceleration structures available (\eg kd-trees, octrees, binary space partitioning (BSP), bounding volume hierarchies (BVH), \etc), regular grid offer greater simplicity in organization and construction than the others.
This is especially beneficial in cases where those data structures have to be updated regularly.
Particularly animated scenes in computer-animated films or changing geometries as in virtual machining require frequent rebuilds or updates of those data structures.
Due to their simplicity and regularity, regular grids provide viable candidates for these scenarios.
However, the VML's regular grid is also the basis for a triangle count optimization called classification which is described in the following section.


\subsection{Classification}
\label{sec:classification}

Every time a solid triangle mesh (stock or swept volume) is added to the grid, the triangles of the mesh have to be mapped to the cells of the grid.
Thereby, each triangle is added to each cell it intersects.
A triangle is therefore potentially referenced from multiple cells.
When the mapping is complete, the affected cells are classified into one of three categories with respect to the newly added mesh.
Cells which are occupied by triangles of the mesh's surface are surface cells.
Cells inside and outside the mesh are inside and outside cells and contain no triangles.
The sketches in figure \ref{fig:classification_before} and \ref{fig:classification_sv} illustrate the classification of a single solid inside the grid (\ie stock) as well as a swept volume before it is merged.

	\label{fig:classification}
\end{figure}

When a new swept volume is added to the grid, its triangle mesh is classified itself and merged into the existing cell classification of the grid.
By limiting the modifiability of the scene to only allowing subtraction volumes, a set of rules for merging a new mesh's classification into the grid's one can be derived and is shown in table \ref{tbl:classification_rules}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}p{2cm}|p{2cm}p{2cm}p{2cm}}
		&         & \multicolumn{3}{l}{Classification of subtraction volume} \\

		\multirow{3}{*}{\parbox{2cm}{Grid \\ classification \\ before}} & outside & outside           & outside           & outside           \\
		& surface & surface           & surface           & outside           \\
		& inside  & inside            & surface           & outside          
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{
		Table containing the classification rules when a new subtraction volume is added to the grid.
		On the left is the classification of a grid cell before the new volume has been added.
		On the top is the classification of a grid cell with regard to the new volume.
		The center of the table shows the outcome when these two classifications are merged.
	}
	\label{tbl:classification_rules}
\end{table}

When the subtraction volume about to add has been classified, it is merged into the grid's classification as follows:
Grid cells which are outside the added subtraction volume remain unchanged.
Surface cells of the added volume become surface cells except they where outside cells before.
Cells inside a subtraction volume always become outside cells, as they are "cut away" by the subtraction volume.
The result of merging a subtraction volume into the grid is visualized in figure \ref{fig:classification_after}.
After classification is complete, all triangles in outside cells can be removed (\cf figure \ref{fig:classification_after_removal}).

This strategy allows to keep the total number of triangles under control as the system should be able to support a large number of swept volumes (theoretically infinite if triangles are regularly eliminated).
%
However, this kind of reduction has a significant consequence.
As the content of outside cells is simply deleted, the stored geometries are no longer closed meshes.
Surface points can still be calculated as shown by the example of the raycast used for visualization in section \ref{sec:raycasting}.

\subsection{Visualization by raycasting}

		Interiors of the ray casting implementation.
		Upon cell entry, the inside counter is determined.
		Firstly, all intersections of the ray with structures inside the cell are calculated.
		The primary ray hits the structures sub 0 and sub 2.
		The surface normal of the nearest hit point with sub 2 points into a different half space than the ray direction.
		Therefore, the ray is outside sub 2 upon entry.
		The normal of the nearest hit point with sub 0 points into the same half space than the ray direction.
		Thus, the ray is inside sub 0 at the entry point.
		As the primary ray does not hit sub 1, a secondary ray is sent to a reference point on a triangle of sub 1.
		As the normal of sub 1 points into a different half space than the secondary ray, the ray is outside sub 1.
		Consequently, as the ray is only inside one structure (sub 0), the inside counter is initialized with -1.
		Then, all previously calculated intersections of the primary ray are ordered ascendingly by distance to the cell entry point and iterated over.
		At each intersection point, the surface normal is again compared with the ray direction.
		If they point into the same half space the structure is exited, otherwise entered.
		Entries decrease the inside counter and are marked with a yellow dot.
		Exists increase the inside counter and are marked with a blue dot.
		When the counter reaches zero, the surface point has been found.

%TODO

As a result the simulated model is described implicitly via subtraction of only subsets of the input triangles (volumes are no longer closed/water-tight).

For visualization, this implicit model is sampled using an adapted ray casting approach \cite{enlight}.
By applying a small set of rules, the surface can be recovered to retrieve an image of the model.
Enlight's data model is described in detail in the author's bachelor thesis \cite{bachelor}.

Simulation and visualization of material removal processes such as in Enlight are vital for verifying the correctness of a machining process.
However, there exist numerous scenarios where an explicit surface model of the final product is required.
Many of these situations occur in CAE such as stress, thermal and safety analyses as well as structural optimizations using finite element methods.
Due to the importance for CAE for assuring quality in modern production processes it is highly desired to be able to retrieve an explicit surface mesh of the implicitly described model of Enlight.
